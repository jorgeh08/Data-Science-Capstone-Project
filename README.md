# Data-Science-Capstone-Project
Natural Language Processing Project


As part of the Coursera Data Science Specialization, a final Capstone project is required. The Capstone project consist in using Natural Leguage Processing tool in order to develope a predictive text algorithm.  
To do this we will use a dataset from a corpus called HC Corpora (www.corpora.heliohost.org). See the readme file at http://www.corpora.heliohost.org/aboutcorpus.html for details on the corpora available.
